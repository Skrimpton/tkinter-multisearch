# tkinter-multisearch
Very simple tool to create search-urls for bookmarked goups of websites, and open them in new tabs. 

### Dependencies
* tkinter
* webbrowser module
* a json file
* an icon file, i'm just realizing. Any .png or .ico will do.

Replace included icon.ico (on windows) or icon.png (linux) with your own if you're paranoid.
