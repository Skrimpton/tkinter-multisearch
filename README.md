# tkinter-multisearch
Very simple tool to create search-urls for bookmarked goups of websites, and open them in new tabs. 
Tested on windows (10) and linux (manjaro kde plasma 5)


### Dependencies
* tkinter
* webbrowser module
* a json file
* an icon file, i'm just realizing. Any .png or .ico will do.

Replace included icon.ico ( windows ) or icon.png ( linux ) with your own, if you're paranoid.
